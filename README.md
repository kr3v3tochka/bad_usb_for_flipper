# bad_usb_for_flipper

This repository contains bad usb scripts. The repository is actively updated. I use these scripts on flipper zero, but they will work for any other bad usb device.

Almost all scripts that transmit any information will work through telegram, so just replace token with your bot token, and id with your chat id
